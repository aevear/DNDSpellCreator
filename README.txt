#README

Basically how this works is, you fill out the little form I have made in the sample for each of your spells. Then, you run the program.

After that you will have two new text files created, one is markup for the homebrewery and the other is JSON for the dnd 5e app

You need to make sure your language is precise with the spell wording, as the 5e app is not particularly forgiving on syntax

After that, load the txt file onto your phone (I used google drive) and click the import spell part of the app. If it works then it wont crash

Best of luck,
